Well... If you haven't noticed it has been quite the while since my last blog post. I might have failed to deliver on my "one post a week" promise that I made, but even though it has been over a year since my last post I have yet to abandon this project of mine. Hopefully sometime in the near future I'll finish/update up the interface and style of this site, but I wanted to make this brief update before I started working on that.

Over the past half year or so life, school amd work got a little crazy, causing me to lose most of my energy for this and other personal projects. Obviously that is no real excuse for the failure to deliver on my promise. While I am uncertain if I'll be returning to the once a week post anytime soon, I will try and push a new post every now and then. 

Sorry for disappearing for so long, and I am excited to incorporate new features to this site!
