We are roughly a year and a half into the Covid-19 pandemic, and with the Delta variant things don't appear to be calming down anytime soon. While we are "returning to normal" in a sense, life still remains changes. From mask mandates, social distancing, and continued strain on our medical system we continue to feel the effects of the virus. I wouldn't be surprised if we never truly return to "normal". 

I distinctly remember talking to my roommate at the very beginning of this all, when talks about going online for college were just beginning. I thought that we would only be online for the remainder of the semester, and by the following fall semester all would be well. Oh how wrong I was. 

Covid-19 will undoubtedly be an event for the history books, something that we look back on like 9/11. Countless lives lost, increased political turmoil, and a drastic change to daily life. This pandemic hit during what could have been some of the most exciting years of my life, but instead I spent over a year cooped up at home taking online courses. With the potential of returning online I have become desperate to regain some of the experiences that my peers and I was robbed of. Meeting new people, going to the bar with some pals, and even enjoying my time sitting through an in-person lecture. Middle/highschool me would have been disgusted if they heard me say that.
