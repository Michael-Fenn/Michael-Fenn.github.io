Sometimes the simplest things are what bring us joy. For me, that simple thing is hiking. As someone that lives near the Appalachian mountain range, I have countless hiking trails to enjoy. While it might not have the highest peaks, going for height isn't the goal, finding wonderful journeys is the true goal. I love how one can get lost in nature, and the scenery that it provides. While the city has its benefits, getting away from it all and returning to nature can be such a refreshing experience. It offers a reset, maybe there's a lot on my mind, or life is getting a little hectic. Spending a handful of hours going out and hiking helps me process everything. 

For me, what really made hiking special was the quality time that I had with my father thanks to it. Hiking helped mend our relationship, helped us understand each other more, and made priceless memories. Walking those trails, climbing those peaks, overcoming those hurdles, and enchanted by nature. These are some of the factors that make hiking such a special thing to me.

However, it has been quite some time since I have gone on a hike, even longer since I have gone with my father. I do miss it, but from health issues, to life getting busy it can be hard to make time for such things. Nonetheless, hiking is a hobby that I still wish to continue doing. Who knows what fantastic journeys the future holds?
