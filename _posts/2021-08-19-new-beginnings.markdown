Welcome to Mike's Mind!

This is my first post for this little project of mine. For the past few years I've been thinking about doing something like this, and as you can tell I've finally gotten around to doing it! I have a lot of different ideas for what I want to write about. While I could vomit out one a day, in order to maintain a balance with my education and work I will be doing one post a week. This also helps me avoid running out of ideas or getting burnt out. 

Some posts will be about me, others about my hobbies, and some will be analytical in nature. Here's a short list of examples you will see in the near future: personal history, personal internet history, video editing, evolution of the internet, space, programming, computers, airsoft, anime, video games, and so much more. 

I have no idea how long I'll be doing this for, it's essentially until I run out of ideas, get too busy, or get bored with it. Even with all that considered I think it would be cool to reach 1000 blog posts! With one a week, that's 52 a year, and if we divide 1000 by 52 we get a whopping 19.23 years worth of blogs! That's only a few years less than I've been alive!

I'm looking forward to this journey, and I hope that a few others will join me along the way!
