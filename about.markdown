Hello!

My name is Michael, but you can call me Mike, Miguel, or whatever else suites your fancy. I am currently a student at UNCC, pursuing a Bachelors degree in computer science. I've spent a little bit of time online almost every day since I was a small 5 year old boy. 

For most of my childhood I despised writing. However, in my last few years of high school I discovered that I actually loved to write, and I was just approaching it wrong. That is why I created this blog, so I can continue to write, on my own accord. 

This will be a weekly blog, with new posts coming up each Sunday. I have no intention to follow a particular subject with this blog, I will simply write whatever I feel like writing about. You can expect to see posts about my life story, both online and offline, my hobbies, things I find interesting, etc. I will be avoiding politics and other "sensitive" topics. 

I'm excited to be doing this, and I hope you'll enjoy some of the posts I end up producing!
