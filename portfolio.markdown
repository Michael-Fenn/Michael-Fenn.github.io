Welcome to my portfolio! You'll find details about some of the projects that I've worked on here. 

##Star Shower

Star Shower is a Unity based game that I created for my Into to Game Design class. It is a top down space shooter inspired by the likes of Galaga and Asteroids.
I created all of the sprites myself using Aseprite and all of the code was written with C#. 
Current iteration has endless wave of enemies with a highscore system. I'd like to add a "story" mode at some point that has designated waves of enemies and bosses.
